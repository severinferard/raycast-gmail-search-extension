    <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong> <p>
                  By downloading or using the extension, these terms will
                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
                  that you read them carefully before using the extension. The extension itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
                  database rights, and other intellectual property rights related
                  to it, still belong to Séverin Férard.
                </p> <p>
                  Séverin Férard is committed to ensuring that the extension is
                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                  reserve the right to make changes to the extension or to charge for
                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                  charge you for the extension or its services without making it very
                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                </p>  <!----> <p>
                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
                  Séverin Férard will not take responsibility for. Certain
                  functions of the extension will require the extension to have an active
                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided
                  by your mobile network provider, but Séverin Férard
                  cannot take responsibility for the extension not working at full
                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                  have any of your data allowance left.
                </p> <p></p> <p>
                  If you’re using the extension outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                  should remember that the terms of the agreement with your
                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                  the duration of the connection while accessing the extension, or
                  other third-party charges. In using the extension, you’re accepting
                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                  charges if you use the extension outside of your home territory
                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                  using the extension, please be aware that we assume that you have
                  received permission from the bill payer for using the extension.
                </p> <p>
                  Along the same lines, Séverin Férard cannot always take
                  responsibility for the way you use the extension i.e. You need to
                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                  Séverin Férard cannot accept responsibility.
                </p> <p>
                  With respect to Séverin Férard’s responsibility for your
                  use of the extension, when you’re using the extension, it’s important to
                  bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is
                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                  to you. Séverin Férard accepts no liability for any
                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                  relying wholly on this functionality of the extension.
                </p> <p>
                  At some point, we may wish to update the extension. The extension is
                  currently available on iOS – the requirements for the 
                  system(and for any additional systems we
                  decide to extend the availability of the extension to) may change,
                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                  using the extension. Séverin Férard does not promise that it
                  will always update the extension so that it is relevant to you
                  and/or works with the iOS version that you have
                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                  accept updates to the extensionlication when offered to you, We may
                  also wish to stop providing the extension, and may terminate use of
                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                  (b) you must stop using the extension, and (if needed) delete it
                  from your device.
